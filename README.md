# CAPTRE
This is the script repository for CAPTRE analysis (cap profiling for translational efficiency).

The repository includes a few sections. 

1. Identification of TSS-isoform pairs with significant TE (bootstraping + FDR control) 

2. List of 5p-UTRs isforms without alternative splicing 

3. Sequence features responsible for TE regulation
